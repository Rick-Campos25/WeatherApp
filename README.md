This Python project is a graphical weather application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city. The user inputs a city name into a text field, and the app retrieves and displays weather data such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset times using the OpenWeatherMap API. The data is presented in a simple and clean Tkinter-based GUI.


Libraries Used:
- tkinter (for the GUI interface)
- requests (to retrieve real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API)
- time (for converting and formatting sunrise and sunset times)

API Used:
- OpenWeatherMap API (requires an API key for access)
